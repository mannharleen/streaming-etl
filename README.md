# THIS IS A WIP PROJECT - PLEAE DO NOT USE YET

# Summary
I am a Data Engineer, and I often have to move data around while performing trasformations. I typically use other projects like node-red, bonobo, AWS Glue, or many a times end up writing scripts. So, I stopped one day and decided to write the one library that I would use hereafter. 

What I want the library to do:
  - Read/Write data from multiple sources
  - Transform data using functions
  - Memory based cache

What I did not want in the library are the bells and whistles like:
- Orchestration
- Data Lineage
- Data Versioning etc.
- Cluster based implementation
